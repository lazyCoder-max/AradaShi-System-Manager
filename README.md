# AradaShi-System-Manager
Arada Software Technologies, PLC has currently developed an online gaming and market system for its
customers. On this system, 4 major services will be delivered to different stake holders of the system
through a single Telegram Bot called AradaShi. These services are:
1. Game Service
2. Wallet Service
3. Gebeya Service
4. Advertisement Service
In these major deliverables there are branches of products which are delivered through a telegram bot.
Currently to maintain and manage those services, employees of the company use MSSQL. But this system
,first and foremost, puts the company’s sensitive and protected information at risk. It also suffers from
being cumbersome for the employee’s which takes a toll on the effective and efficient delivery of the
services as a whole.
In order to tackle these problems, it is vital to develop a system that is used to manage and view reports of
the services delivered to the users.
